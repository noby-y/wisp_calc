# Noita Wisp Calulator
This is a fast and simple wisp calulator console app for Noita. Feel free to use it, there is no monthly subscription :)

### How to start
1. Download just the infini_wisp_calc.exe from the Release tab:
https://github.com/noby-y/wisp_calc/releases/tag/v1.0.0
2. Launch the app and it will open a console window
3. The app will ask to enter the minimum and the maximum lifetime values
4. After you've entered those values it will output a table of different solutions together with the total number of modifiers required for each solution

### Additional info
- If the table doesn't output correctly, please read config.cfg file that will auto-generate when you first launch the app
- You can set a filter on which modifiers are allowed and which aren't through config.cfg
- Advanced mode coming soon
- Currently only works for windows, although you're free to download the source code and recompile it for Linux if you can
